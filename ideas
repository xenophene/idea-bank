1. Song shuffle.
How about a site, where you just land and start listening to music served from a Music relation graph via a Random walk on it.
The idea is to quickly discover new music by listening to 20-30s snippets of the songs, and then marking them as "Like it, show similar" or "Hate it, show something else". By making this binary choice at each step, the user decides how to navigate in the music graph which can be obtained through Yahoo! music API or Grooveshark or something similar. 
I think this idea can be made into a snazzy music taste discovery tool, and can be tried out soon.

2. Collab on the internet
The only form of true real-time, collaborative that I have done on the Internet has been Conference chats and Google Doc manipulation. Suppose, I am doing a very regular activity like watching Youtube video, and I want to watch it with my friend and keep discussing it with in parallel by pausing the video. What is required, is an integration of something like Youtube and Skype, so you can watch the videos, and then switch to Skype to communicate. There has to be a real-time coordinator sitting in between which does this in a neat-interface.
